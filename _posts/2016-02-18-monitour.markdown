  In an effort to get better at Angular I decided to create a small side project focusing on my love for PC hardware (there are worse hobbies ok!).

  The /r/monitors subreddit constantly gets barraged with the same questions over and over with regards to what monitor someone should by. As far as I know there is no maintained FAQ or official buying guide (likely to not favor a single party hosting affiliate links) which presented an opportunity to provide an easy interface to filter down some of the most popular monitors based on the most popular features. Thus, <a href="https://www.moni-tour.com">Moni-Tour</a> was born.

  It was a simple enough site to create with the hardest part being the filter that allows for filtering on multiple properties. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23983322/angularjs-checkbox-filter">This</a> SO was more than helpful in getting things up and running in that regard. All in all I'm content with the functionality for how little effort it took to get up and running on AWS. In the future I'd like to perhaps make this a feature on a site with a little more in depth reviews and ad monetization.
