<p>
  I've been wanting to post up a Django auth demo app to get some feedback (internal apps at work are authenticated via a Google account obviously). Unfortunately I wanted to use <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/">Polymer 1.0</a> but there aren't any solid tutorials out yet and the documentation is still a work in progress.

  The work in progress is up <a href="https://github.com/erik-farmer/django-auth-example">here</a>. Once I throw in some more presentable markup and make some minor changes to make things "the Django 1.8 way" (my <a href="http://twoscoopspress.org/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8">Two Scoops</a> 1.8 just got in!) I will look for some friendly audits.
