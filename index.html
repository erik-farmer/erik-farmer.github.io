        <p>
          I am a programmer in the California Bay Area.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my undergrad I interned for a Bay Area video game publisher and wanted to be in the games industry. After graduating and working in the field full time I realized that the day to day work did not carry the same excitement as working a trade show floor did.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had been learning basic ruby and python on the side and found the challenge so enjoyable I decided to quit my job and commit to learning web development full time. That was 2013, since then I have worked with a satellite hardware start up, as an internal application consultant at Google and currently as a software engineer with getTalent.
        </p>
        <p>I love <b>full stack development</b> and currently use <b>Python</b>/<b>Flask</b>. I also have experience working with <b>Ruby on Rails</b> and <b>Django</b> but more importantly I enjoy learning new things.</p>
        <p>In my free time I like to make small tools that help me learn more about programming, explore the outdoors with my dog, and building gaming PCs.</p>
